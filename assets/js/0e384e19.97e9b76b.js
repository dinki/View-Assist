A control automation is created per satellite device which handles things like identifying the input and output devices attached, different modes, screen timeouts and some of the core functions.  The custom views are written in a way that they are aware of the device that is displaying the view and can produce different output on different devices at the same time.  The View Assist satellite devices are also capable of communicating with each other which allows for creating broadcast announcements to selected devices."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"View Assist is easily customizable once the base configuration is in place.

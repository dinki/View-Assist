View Assist is a collection of devices, configurations, automations, extensions, and views that operate with Home Assistant's Assist voice assistant.  This section will guide you through the four steps to configuring your system.  It is advisable to go through each section and ensure everything is in place before attempting to start using View Assist.

Four steps are required to get things set up:

* Assist Pipeline - This is the actual configuration Home Assistant needs to configure and start using the Assist voice assistant
* Microphone Input Device - This is the device that provides the voice input from the satellite device and sends it to Home Assistant for processing voice commands
* Display Output Device (optional) - This is the device that shows visual information received from View Assist.  Note that View Assist can work with voice only devices if desired.
* View Assist Integration - The View Assist framework is established with a simple installation through HACS

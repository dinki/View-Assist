# Installing Microphone Input Devices
In order to leverage your tablet or other device as a voice assistant satellite, you'll need to have an application installed that will be responsible for providing audio input to Home Assistant for processing. 

Several options exist for getting microphone data from your Android device to Home Assistant.  **You need to pick ONE of the following:**

* [HassMic](./hass-mic.md) - Recommended.  HassMic is a standalone application and integration that works great with View Assist.  While not technically a part of the VA project, the author has worked hand in hand with the View Assist team to ensure full compatibility and provides information used by View Assist
* [Wyoming Satellite on Android](./wyoming.md) - VA user pantherale0 provides a guide to get Wyoming satellite capabilities with on device wake word detection on Android.  This is fantastic but does have a more complicated install.  Definitely worth checking out if you are techinical enough to install
* [Stream Assist](./stream-assist.md) - This is the orignal method for getting microphone to Home Assistant.  While it does still work, it is more involved to set up and response time is slower than using either of the alternatives above.  We will, however, continue to support it but do encourage folks to try the alternatives.


## Installation

### HassMic

See instructions on github page

### Wyoming Satellite on Android

See instructions on github page

### Stream Assist

We'll leverage Stream Assist running on your Home Assistant instance to access those streams and pass the audio into the voice pipeline. We'll cover setting up Stream Assist in a future section.

The following Android applications have been tested and found to be working. The current recommendation is to use IP Webcam, however the choice is ultimately yours. You only need to install and configure ONE of the following applications.

- [IP Webcam (Recommended)](#ip-webcam)
- [RtpMic](#rtpmic)

Detailed install video: https://youtu.be/-7cHfqZMa1c

### Installation
1. Download and install the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam).  

### Configuration
1. Find the IPWebcam Icon and tap it to launch.
1. Scroll down until you see the **Service Control** heading and tap on **Optional Permissions**.
1. Tap **Allow streaming in background** and then turn on **Allow display over other apps**.
1. Tap back and then deactivate the checkbox on **Show camera overlay**. 
1. Tap back and scroll up until you see **Power management** tap it and under *Misc* Turn on **Disable notification** and **Stream on device boot**. 
1. Tap back to get back to the main setting screen.
1. Scroll down until you see the *Misc* section and tap on **Audio mode**. Choose **Audio Only**.

    :::info 
    While you can stream both audio and video via IPWebcam, we recommend using the **Audio Only** mode to reduce bandwidth and minimize video being streamed to your HA instance. Many users also prefer this due to the location of these tablet devices on the interior of their home such as in bedrooms.
    :::

1. Tap back and then scroll down and tap on **Start server**.  
1. When prompted, Allow all permissions as requested by Android OS (camera, microphone, etc.)

## RtpMic {#rtpmic}
:::note
RtpMic can only be installed via the Google Play store on devices running older versions of Android OS. Users have been successful manually sideloading the application on newer versions but that is beyond this tutorial.

As of Dec 2024 RtpMic is not available via Google Play Store any more

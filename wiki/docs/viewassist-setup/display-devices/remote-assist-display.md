# Remote Assist Display Installation and configuration

This project is meant to be an alternative to browser_mod for building dashboards controllable from Home Assistant, specifically for use with ViewAssist.  As an added bonus, you can skip the BrowserMod installation making this a complete browser and frontend control system for View Assist.

### Installation

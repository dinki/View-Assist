# View Assist Companion App

The View Assist Companion App is an Android application and Home Assistant integration to compliment the View Assist project. It has been built from the ground up to simplify the setup of devices when using View Assist and provide a lower barrier to entry than other solutions.

Combining an Android application and a Home Assistant integration (to control your device), this solution offers:

- Voice support for HA voice assistants with on device wake word
- Browser functionality to display your HA dashboards on your device
- A media player to play your favourite music / radio station from HA
- A comprehensive set of controls & sensor entities to use in your automations and dashboards

# Browser Mod {#browsermod}
Browser Mod 2 custom integration was previously heavily used by View Assist but now has been relegated to one particular function.  Browser Mod is now used for device identification only.  We hope to eventually make this an internal feature but until then it will need to be configured for this purpose.

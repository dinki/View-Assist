View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom views which receive data from custom sentences. On this page you will find a gallery of premade custom views provided by community members. These are the views that are used by the [community contributions custom sentences](../cc-sentences/index.md) or provide additional functionality to the View Assist dashboard.  You will find links to the requirements and installation instructions.


We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.

View Assist was built with the goal of allowing custom expansion through custom automation, scripts and views.  We have been fortunate to be adopted by many users and those users have brought their creations to life and are willing to share those with others.  This section contains those contributions.


:::info[Word of Caution]
These user contributions are supported by the contributors only as they are not a part of the core of View Assist
:::

The following sections are available:
- [Community Contributions Custom Sentences](cc-sentences/index.md) - Contains custom sentence automations and scripts that do not fit the core of View Assist.  This may be due to the reliance on certain integrations, hardware or conditions that do not make it a fit for core but still provides functionality for those who can apply
- [Community Contributions Custom Views](cc-views/index.md) - These are the views that are used by the custom sentences or provide additional functionality to the View Assist dashboard
- [Community Contributions Tips and Tricks](cc-tipsandtricks/index.md) - A place to store useful information

View Assist is easily extendable by adding custom sentences which provide data to different custom views. In this section you will find a gallery of premade custom sentence blueprints for easy installation. You will find links to the requird integrations, required views and installation instructions.

We encourage everyone to share their creations so that others might enjoy what you have brought to life.  Note that these submissions will be provided under the 'Community Submissions' section for the blueprints, views and integration requirements.  These items are supported by the author of these submissions and any questions or comments should be directed to the author or discussed in the 'Community Submissions' channel on our Discord server.

User can search for general knowledge questions on people, places, things, etc on Wikipedia.  This custom sentence blueprint requires that Pyscript be installed (Watch the [Install video](https://youtu.be/jpJxZaisbGQ)).  Download the file 'viewassist-wikisearch.py' and place it in your Home Assistant configuration directory in the 'pyscript' subdirectory.  

You will also need the [info](../views/info) and [infopic](../views/info) views installed.

User can search for general knowledge questions on people, places, things, etc on Wikipedia.  This custom sentence blueprint requires that Pyscript be installed (Watch the [Install video](https://youtu.be/jpJxZaisbGQ)).  Download the file ['viewassist-wikisearch.py'](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dinki/View-Assist/refs/heads/main/View_Assist_custom_sentences/Search_Wikipedia/viewassist-wikisearch.py) and place it in your Home Assistant configuration directory in the 'pyscript' subdirectory.  

You will also need the [info](../views/info) and [infopic](../views/info) views installed.

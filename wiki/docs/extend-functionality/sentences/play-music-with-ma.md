## Requirements
  * Music Assistant server installed and integrated with Home Assistant
  * View: [Music view](../views/music)
  * The recently added musicplayer_device must be added to your View Assistant device configuration as explained in the [Satellite Custom Device Configuration](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/wiki/View-Assist-device-configuration#satellite-custom-device-configuration) portion of the wiki.  This should be a Music Assistant player device.  Typically these will be named the same as your mediaplayer_device but with a _2 on the end

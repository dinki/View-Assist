The View Assist integration allows for easy creation and management of View Assist satellite devices. The following section will demonstrate:

- [View Assist Master Configuration](./masterconfig-configuration/index.md) - The View Assist master configuration contains the default values for all satellites. These settings make it easy to deploy many satellites without the need to modify each with the same values.
- [View Assist Satellite Creation](./satellite-creation/index.md) - Adding a new device to the View Assist collection of satellites

Once complete, be sure to create the automations you want to use by creating them with the included View Assist blueprints. See the [Automations & Views](../extend-functionality/index.md) section for more information.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdinki%2FView-Assist%2Fmain%2FView+Assist+custom+sentences%2FSearch+Wikipedia%2Fblueprint-searchwikipedia.yaml)

User can search for general knowledge questions on people, places, things, etc on Wikipedia.  This custom sentence blueprint requires that Pyscript be installed (Watch the [Install video](https://youtu.be/jpJxZaisbGQ)).  Download the file 'viewassist-wikisearch.py' and place it in your Home Assistant configuration directory in the 'pyscript' subdirectory.  

You will also need the [info](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/tree/main/View%20Assist%20dashboard%20and%20views/views/info) and [infopic](https://github.com/dinki/View-Assist/tree/main/View%20Assist%20dashboard%20and%20views/views/infopic) views installed.

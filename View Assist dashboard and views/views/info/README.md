This card can be added by copy pasting.  One variable in the configuration will need to be made for the background image to be visible:

```
variables:
  background: /local/viewassist/announcebird.png
```
The background image will need to be uploaded to the web directory located within the config directory of the Home Assistant server.  That path is then added to the configuration file.

You can, of course, use any image you like.  I created this one using a public domain image that you can find [here](https://www.rawpixel.com/image/6293393/vector-background-flower-public-domain)
